## Tree viewer
### FigTree
[FigTree](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/) is designed as a graphical viewer of phylogenetic trees and as a program for producing publication-ready figures. As with most of my programs, it was written for my own needs so may not be as polished and feature-complete as a commercial program. In particular it is designed to display summarized and annotated trees produced by BEAST.

Compiled binaries (for Mac, Windows and Linux) are available from the FigTree GitHub repository.

Source code is available from [GitHub](https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/).

Example tree to view is [here](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.s1s75)
